# Braille-Communication-device
This is a communication device designed using the following equipment to help the blind communicate using the existing braille script code.

**MATERIALS USED:**
Arduino UNO
Push buttons
jumper wires
metal plate for support
Existing Braille Code

**ADD ONS:**
Liquid Crystal Display
Speaker

**CONNECTIONS AND WORKING:**

We have arranged six push buttons in 3 by 2 fashion on the metal plate and connected them to the arduino board using jumper wires.

This is the exisiting braille script code

The users can push the buttons according to the code and the corresponding character will be displayed in the serial monitor of our Arduino IDE on the laptop.

An LCD and a speaker can also be used for the same purpose and appropriate modules must be imported before fitting it into our code and the model.

You can find the Arduino IDE supported code in this repo
